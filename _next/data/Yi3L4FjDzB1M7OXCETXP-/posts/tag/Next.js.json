Isn't React itself already a framework for JavaScript?\r\n\r\nWell ... first of all, React is a \"library\" for JavaScript. That seems to be important for some people.\r\n\r\nNot for me, but still, there is a valid point: React already is a framework / library for JavaScript. So it's already an extra layer on top of JS.\r\n\r\n## Why would we then need NextJS?\r\n\r\nBecause NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).\r\n\r\nIn this article, we'll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:\r\n\r\n- File-based Routing\r\n- Built-in Page Pre-rendering\r\n- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities\r\n- Image Optimization\r\n- Much More\r\n\r\n## File-based Routing\r\n\r\n![Create routes via your file + folder structure](nextjs-file-based-routing.png)\r\n\r\n...
